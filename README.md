*A Web Framework for AI-Assisted Repair Workflows*

## Overview
FSTA is a browser-based research prototype that structures repair as a digital, data-rich process.
It implements the workflow developed in the master thesis *Machine Reasoning and the Logics of Repair* and runs fully client-side, communicating through a serverless API layer hosted on **Vercel** (using Google Gemini 2.5 Pro Vision models).
No installation or cloning is required — simply open the deployed web app and follow the five steps of the repair process.

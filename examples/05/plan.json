      "rationale": "The philosophy demands a precise, controlled act of subtraction. Securing the object as a single, monolithic entity ensures the cut is a deliberate dissection that transforms the whole, rather than a chaotic accident. Stability is paramount to executing this singular, transformative vision.",

      "description": "Using a laser line or a large straightedge, scribe a single, continuous cut line across the entire chair assembly. The plane of this cut should be strategically chosen to intersect the crack on the front right leg (damage_02), the glue residue (damage_05), the crack on the front left leg (damage_03), the scuffs on the seat (damage_01), and the back left leg with the poorly repaired glider (damage_04).",
